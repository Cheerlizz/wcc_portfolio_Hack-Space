                    <strong>Pablo Neruda</strong> is one of the most famous poets of the 20th century, 
                    but he left a more complicated legacy than many realize. 
                    He was launched into international recognition at age 20, 
                    and eventually became a Nobel Prize winner, a diplomat, and a senator. 
                    He's been honored as a “resistance poet” and a voice for the oppressed, 
                    challenging aristocracy and dictatorship in Chile and across the world. 
                    And since his death in 1973, 
                    he has been remembered especially for his celebrations of love and sexuality—as one scholar put it, 
                    as a “frank, sensuous spokesman for <a class="bold" href="../Love Sonnets/Love Sonnets.html"><strong>love</strong></a>.”
